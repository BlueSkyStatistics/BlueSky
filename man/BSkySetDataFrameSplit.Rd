\arguments{
\item{col.names}{These are the column names/variable names that you want to split the dataset by, e.g. col.names =c("var1", "var2"). To reset the split, set to c().}

\description{
Splits the data into groups based on the factors selected, once the dataset is split, the analysis you select is performed independently for each split. For example if you run a crosstabulation analysis or a hypothesis test, this analysis is performed independently for each split (the output of the analysis is also generated separately for each split). 
OR
Removes the split on the dataset. Splits, see Data>Group By>Set Split splits the data into groups based on the factors selected, once the dataset is split, the analysis you select is performed independently for each split.
