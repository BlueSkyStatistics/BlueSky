\arguments{
\item{vars:}{The variables in a character vector to extract components from}

\item{cor:}{A boolean that specifies whether the calculation should use a correlation or covariance matrix}

\item{componentsToRetain:}{A numeric that Specifies the number of components to retain in the dataset. A new variable is created in the dataset for each component invoked}

\item{â€‹generateScreeplot:}{Generates a screeplot}

\item{prefixForComponents:}{Prefix to use when saving the components to a dataset}

\item{dataset:}{The name of the dataset as a string}
}
\value{
princomp returns a list with class "princomp" containing the following components
sdev: the standard deviations of the principal components.
loadings: the matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns contain the eigenvectors). This is of class "loadings": see loadings for its print method.
center: the means that were subtracted.
scale: the scalings applied to each variable.
n.obs: the number of observations.
scores: if scores = TRUE, the scores of the supplied data on the principal components. These are non-null only if x was supplied, and if covmat was also supplied if it was a covariance list. For the formula method, napredict() is applied to handle the treatment of values omitted by the na.action.
call: the matched call.
na.action: If relevant.
}
\description{
Performs a principal components analysis on the given numeric data matrix and returns the results as an object of class princomp. Internally calls princomp in the stats package.
